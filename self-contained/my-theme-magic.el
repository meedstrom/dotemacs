;;; Commentary:

;; Features:

;; 1. On init, select a random theme from a user-configured list.  Actually,
;;    different lists for day and night.

;; 2. Better load-theme command, that first unloads previous themes, and runs
;;    a hook so you can trigger e.g. powerline-reset, prism-set-colors

;; 3. For Prism users, provide a way to desaturate a "fruit-salad" theme but
;;    not themes that already use toned-down colors

;; 4. Command to cycle themes randomly (use with `repeat' for maximum pleasure)

;; 5. Command to toggle a timer for regularly switching theme


;; Note to self, some rules of thumb to distinguish good themes from bad:

;; - if you have a high-DPI monitor, remember that italics are ok now
;; - for prism-mode, none of the faces should be grey
;; - for prism-mode, none of the faces should be much darker than the rest
