;; Auto-commit on save in specific directories.
;;
;; Multiple auto-commits in a row, i.e. commits with the message "Auto-commit",
;; are amended if it's still the same day.  In typical conditions, that means
;; your git log ends up showing one commit per day.

;;; Code:

(defvar my-auto-pull-and-push-dirs
  '("/home/kept/roam/organice/")
  "In which directories do you want `vc-pull-and-push' on save?")

(defvar my-auto-commit-dirs
  '("/home/kept/roam/"
    "/home/me/.doom.d/")
  "In which directories do you want to auto-commit all changes?")

(defun my-auto-commit-maybe ()
  "Do a new commit if the last was on a different day.
Otherwise just amend today's commit.

Only operate if the project root directory is a member of
`my-auto-commit-dirs'.

If there are untracked files, do nothing and print a message,
because in this situation it's more possible that the user will
want to do the commits manually.

Suitable on `after-save-hook'."
